// This code exports functions from two different files: morningGreet and eveningGreet.
// The morningGreet function generates a personalized morning greeting,
// while the eveningGreet function generates a personalized evening greeting.
// This allows users to import both functions from a single entry point,
// making it easier to use them in their applications.
// The morningGreet function can be used to greet someone in the morning,
// while the eveningGreet function can be used to greet someone in the evening.
